This a Battleship project specific to a job interview using a interactive interface using Tkinter.
The placement algorithm uses an heuristic method, which can replace ships if they are "badly" placed. That way it avoid to reach any dead ends.
However, it can be blocked when the solution is "hard to find", i.e they're too many boat for the algorithm to find a rapid solution.
I set a timeout of 6 seconds to avoid a crash of the window.
